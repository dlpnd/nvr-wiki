## FirstPersonView

### BaseBlurRadius

 Strength of the blurriness caused by depth of Field.

>Default: 2.0

---

### BlurFallOff

 Hyperfocal distance (x1000). Before this distance, near and far field are blurred. After, only the near field is.

>Default: 1.5

---

### DiameterRange

 Bokeh treshold. Areas with brightness above this value will bloom in a bokeh like effect.

>Default: 0.8

---

### DistantBlur

 Activate a constant blurriness in the far distance to hide LOD.

>Default: true

---

### DistantBlurEndRange

 Far end of the area blurred in the distance (fully blurry).

>Default: 150000

---

### DistantBlurStartRange

 Start of the area blurred in the distance (not yet blurry).

>Default: 30000

### Enabled

 Wether to activate the DOF effect in first person.

>Default: true

---

### Mode

 Chose when the DOF is activated: 0: always, 1: not during dialog, 2: only in dialog.

>Default: 0

---

### NearBlurCutOff

 Close up range that doesn't get blurred to avoid blurry gun/player character.

>Default: 100

---

### Radius

 Radius for the bokeh blur.

>Default: 1.5

## Status

### Enabled

 Depth of Field blurriness with animated autofocus. Simulates a real camera autofocus with a focus on playability.

>Default: true
