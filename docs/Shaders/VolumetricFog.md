# VolumetricFog

---

## Main

### Amount

Global multiplier for fog strength in exteriors

>Default: 1.0

---

### SunPower

Controls the influence of Sun Color when shining through fog

>Default: 0.2

---

### FogSaturation

Tune the saturation of the fog

>Default: 1.7

---

### MinimumBaseFog

How much fog will be present as a base line when weather has no fog

>Default: 0.2

---

### WeatherImpact

How much the fog will scale with weather fog strength

>Default: 0.6

---

### DistantFogRange

Range of the distance fog that blends moutains into the sky.

>Default: 0.9

---

### DistantFogBlend

Blending power of the distant fog

>Default: 0.3

---

### DistantFogHeight

Height limit for the distant fog. If set to 0, will use the sky as a mask.

>Default: 0.3

---

### HeightFogDensity

Density multiplier for the general height fog

>Default: 0.6

---

### HeightFogFalloff

Vertical falloff of atmospheric height fog,

>Default: 50.0

---

### HeightFogDist

Distance multiplier for Height fog. Pushes back the fog.

>Default: 0.3

---

### HeightFogSkyColor

Strong fogs will use the weather fog color instead of the sky. This setting changes how strong the fog should be for that.

>Default: 4.0

---

### HeightFogHeight

"Sea level" from which the Height fog starts to decrease.

>Default: 3.0

---

### HeightFogBlend

General strength of the impact of Height fog on the final look.

>Default: 1.0

---

### HeightFogRolloff

Pushes back the Height fog without changing the far distance. Changes the curve of progression

>Default: 1.3

---

### Extinction

Light lost due to absorption of particles when seen throught the fog.

>Default: 3.0

---

### Inscattering

Light gained from light scattering when seen through the fog.

>Default: 1.9

---

### FogNight

Scales the fog distances at night.

>Default: 2.0

---

### SimpleFogSkyColor

Strong fogs will use the weather fog color instead of the sky. This setting changes how strong the fog should be for that.

>Default: 20.0

---

### SimpleFogHeight

Limit the sky influence/height rate of dissipation for simple fog.

>Default: 0.5

---

### SimpleFogBlend

General strength of the impact of simple fog on the final look.

>Default: 1.0

---

## Interiors

## Status

### Enabled

Volumetric fog shader tinted by the sun. Rendered after shadows and other effects for more accurate effect.

>Default: true
